### Introduction
* Decision tree learning is a method for approximating discrete-valued target functions, in which the learned function is represented by a decision tree. 
* Learned trees can also be re-represented as sets of if-then rules to improve human readability. 
### Decision Tree Representation
* Decision trees classify instances by sorting them down the tree from the root to some leaf node, which provides the classification of the instance. 
* Each node in the tree specifies some attribute of the instance, and each branch descending from that node corresponds to one of the possible values for this attribute. 
* In general, decision trees represent a disjunction of conjunctions of constraints on the attribute values of instances.
