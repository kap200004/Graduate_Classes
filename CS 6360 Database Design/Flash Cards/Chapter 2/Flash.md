What is the Three-schema architecture?
Back:
It is proposed to help achieve and visualize 3 of the four characteristics of the database approach: 1) use of a catalog to store the database description so as to make it self-describing. 2) insulation of programs and data. 3) Support of multiple user views.

START
Basic
Front:
What are the levels of the three-schema architecture?
Back:
1. Internal level- describes the physical storage structure of the database. 
2. Conceptual level- describes the structure of the whole database for a community of users. Concentrates on describing entities, data types, relationships, user operations and constraints. 
3. External or view level- Each describes the part of the database that particular user group is interested in and hides the rest of the database from that user group.

Data Independence
<!--ID: 1724873939361-->
END

START
Basic
Front:
Why does data independence occur when changes are made?
Back:
Data independence occurs because when the schema is changed at some level, the schema at the next higher level remains unchanged; only the ***mapping*** between the two levels is changed.

Basic
Front:
What is the Storage definition language?
Back:
In databases where there is strict separation between the conceptual and internal levels, the DDL is used to specify the conceptual schema only while the SDL is used to specify the internal schema.

Front:
High-level DML vs Low-Level
Back:
High level DMLS have statements processed by a compiler into lower level, one statement can query a a whole set, also known as set-at-a-time. The low level must be written to loop through and query each record at a time. High-level query specifies which, low-level specifies how.

Front:
Of the two types of data independence (see previous question), which is harder to achieve? Why?

Logical Independence is harder to achieve because it allows structural and constraint changes without affecting application programs which is a much stricter requirement.
