- Retrieval operations such as query will not violate constraints because the data is already in the database. 
- The insert operation provides a list of attributes for a new tuple t that is to be inserted into a relation $R$. It may violate: 
	- Domain Constraints
	- Key Constraints
	- Entity Constraints
	- Referential Integrity. 
- If an insertion violates one or more constraints the default option is to reject the insertion. The DBMS will not allow you to violate constraints. 
- The delete operation can violate only referential integrity if the tuple being deleted is referenced by foreign keys from other tuples. If a violation occurs we can:
	- Reject the deletion. 
	- Set null or set default- modify the referencing attribute values that cause the violation. 
	- Cascade- propagate the deletion by deleting tuples that reference the tuple that is being deleted. 
- For the update operation, if the attribute is not part of a primary key nor of a foreign key, it usually causes no problem, however updating a primary or foreign key has similar issues as with insert and delete. 
- We can use the options of cascade, set default, set null, and reject when using on update or on delete commands to cascade the update throughout the database. 
### Basic SQL
- SQL- Structured Query Language. It includes the data definition language, and the data manipulation language, and view definition language. 
- SQL language is case insensitive for keywords and namespaces. 
- SQL data values are case sensitive, i.e. the attribute values. 
- For readability, some case style conventions may be used.
- Each statement in SQL ends with a semicolon. 
- A SQL schema is identified by a schema name. It includes an authorization identifier and descriptors for each element. The authorization identifier is the admin. 
- Schema elements include: Tables, Constraints, Views, Domain. 
- The create statement is the main sql command for definition. The create schema statement: CREATE SCHEMA schema_name [auth];
- To specify a new relation we use the create table command: CREATE TABLE table_name
- Virtual relations are created through the CREATE VIEW statement. 
- The order of table creation matters, for instance if you have circular references, some foreign keys may cause errors. 
- The check clause puts constraints on tuples and goes at the end of the crate table command.
